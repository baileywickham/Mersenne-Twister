# Mersenne Twister
This is a port of the python random library implimentation of the Mersenne Twister to golang. It is commented based on the origonal paper.

The Mersenne Twister is a method for generating pseudo random data based on an inital seed. The inital seed is usually generated from a physical source such as the temp of the CPU. This seed can be then used to generate more data.
